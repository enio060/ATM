# ATM
In this simulation, the object emulates the functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) while utilizing the Polish Personal Identification Number (PESEL) as the unique identifier for transactions. The system is designed to provide robust security measures to prevent the use of counterfeit PESELs and to safeguard against any attempts to input negative numerical values.
